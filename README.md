# MERN-TodoApp (MongoDB, Express js, React js, Node js)

The Task Manager project aims to provide a simple and intuitive interface for managing tasks. Users can add new tasks with titles and descriptions, mark them as completed or incomplete, edit task details including titles and descriptions, and delete tasks as needed. The application will also display a list of tasks along with their current status (completed or incomplete), allowing users to easily track their progress and manage their workload efficiently. With its straightforward functionality, Task Manager streamlines the task management process, making it convenient for individuals or teams to stay organized and productive.

## Tools and Languages
1. **MongoDB Community Server with MongoDB Compass**
   - In the MERN Todo app project, MongoDB serves as the database management system, providing a scalable and flexible solution for storing and managing the todo list data efficiently.

2. **Node js, Express js, React js**
   - Node.js: Serves as the backend runtime environment, facilitating server-side logic and database interactions using JavaScript.
   - Express.js: Acts as the backend framework, providing a minimalist and flexible web application framework to handle HTTP requests and routes efficiently.
   - React.js: Functions as the frontend library, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces through reusable components and efficient state management.

3. **VS Code**
   - Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is an open-source code editor widely used in MERN stack projects, offering robust features and extensions for efficient development workflows.
  
4. **Browser**
   - In the MERN Todo app project, the browser serves as the user interface, allowing users to interact with the application's frontend components built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, facilitating seamless task management and user experience.

## Installation
